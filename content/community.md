_“I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly”_

S. John 10:10


***A CHURCH IS A COMMUNITY WHICH EXISTS FOR OTHERS.*** So, when we come in
through the door, it is expressly to go out again to our everyday lives and relationships. The proclamation of scripture, the consecration of bread and wine, our receiving Holy Communion, all lead to the climax of our worship—the Dismissal: _“Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.”_


Our service to Our Lord is shown by service to our
neighbour. When we pray for others in the Eucharist, it is so
that we may put our concern into action. We are God’s
agents in helping to bring that abundant life which he wills
for all people, especially to those so obviously without it: the
poor, the lonely, the sick.


Need—lack of abundant life—can take many forms, physical,
emotional, spiritual. We can be ready to respond to need,
whatever it is, by action, by word or by the Christ-like
character others look for in us.


We pray that you may find in the Church of St Alcuin in
Touraine an example of Christian love and care.


_“Sir, we wish to see Jesus”_

S. John 12:21
