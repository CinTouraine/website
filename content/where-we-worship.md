## WHERE WE WORSHIP


### IN BOTH OUR WORSHIP CENTRES WE ARE MOST GRATEFUL TO BE OFFERED HOSPITALITY BY OUR ECUMENICAL PARTNERS.


***The Temple in Tours*** is a delightful building, in the centre of the
city. Constructed in the 17th century as a Roman Catholic chapel. it
fell into secular ownership during the French Revolution, not returning
to religious use until 1827, when the Church of England moved in. It
was later bought by the Eglise reformée, but the Anglicans stayed
there until the chaplaincy ceased in 1891. We returned there in 2014.


Excellent public transport services run close by and parking may be
found in the adjacent Place de la Préfecture.


***At Savigny-en-Véron we celebrate in the Parish
Church of St Michel***, part of the Catholic parish of Sainte Jeanne
d’Arc en Chinonais. Although there has been a church on the site
since the 12th century, by the middle of the 19th century its condition
necessitated a new structure, authorised by the municipality in 1845.
It has opened its doors to us since 2015.


There is ample parking in the square in front of the church.
