##OUR CHAPLAINCY’S SAFEGUARDING POLICY

The protection from harm of children and adults who may be vulnerable is of paramount importance to us.

As a chaplaincy
within the Diocese of Europe, we comply fully with the requirements of the Diocese’s Safeguarding Policy:

We will not tolerate the abuse of children or adults in any form.
Specifically, within our Chaplaincy we are committed to:

- The care, nurture, and respectful pastoral ministry of all children, young persons and adults
- The safeguarding and protection of all children, young persons and adults who may be vulnerable
- The establishing of safe, caring communities which provide a loving environment where there is a culture of ‘informed
vigilance’ as to the dangers of abuse.
- The careful selection and training of all those with any safeguarding responsibility within the Church, including the use
of available criminal records disclosures and relevant vetting and barring schemes.
- Preventing abuse or the likelihood of abuse by encouraging and adopting a pro-active stance to safeguarding; responding
to the slightest concern whether by rumour, speculation or from an anonymous source – every safeguarding concern
will be taken seriously.
- Ensuring that any concern about safeguarding must be passed onto someone in the Diocesan Safeguarding Team as
there are no legal barriers to sharing such concerns.
- Responding without delay to every complaint made which suggests that a child, young person or adult may have been
harmed - co-operating with the local police, relevant local agencies and any other relevant body (eg other faith groups)
in any investigation.
- Seeking to work with anyone who has suffered abuse, developing with them an appropriate ministry of informed pastoral care.
- Seeking to challenge any abuse of power, especially by anyone in a position of trust.
- Seeking to offer pastoral care and support, including supervision and referral to the proper authorities, to any member
of our church community known to have offended against a child, young person or vulnerable adult.
