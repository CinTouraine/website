We offer a very warm welcome to all who want to celebrate the love of God with us and hope you enjoy our service. We come together to celebrate the presence of Christ in word and sacrament: the Holy Communion or Eucharist—     <em><strong>the Lord’s own Service     for the Lord’s own People     on the Lord’s own Day.</strong></em></p><p>And so we follow Our Lord’s command <em><strong>Do this in memory of me</strong></em> as the Church has done ever since her earliest days (Acts 2.42; Acts 20.7).</p><p>We are part of the Church of England and our worship follows the Anglican pattern. But we are not an exclusive group: we are pleased to welcome people of any Christian background—or none. We aim to be a Church for every English-speaking Christian, a spiritual home for all who want to worship in English.</p><p>As our name implies our home is the 2,366 square miles of the Indre-et-Loire département of France (Touraine is its traditional name), but we cover a much wider area than that. We draw regular worshippers from no fewer than three different regions.</p><p>So, whether you live here, or are visiting, we warmly invite you to join us.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 16, 2023</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://churchintouraine.org/authors/church-of-st-alcuin-of-york/" rel="author">Church of St Alcuin of York</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://churchintouraine.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://churchintouraine.org/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
