<p class="align-center"><strong>ALCUIN WAS AN IMPORTANT ENGLISH CHRISTIAN OF THE LATE 8TH AND EARLY 9TH CENTURIES</strong>, who spent his last years in Tours—as Abbot of S. Martin’s. Under his influence, the city added to its fame by becoming a significant intellectual and artistic centre.<br><br>Probably born in the year 735 in or near York, he entered the cathedral school there as a child, continued as a Scholar and eventually became Master. In 781 he went to Aachen, having been recruited by the emperor Charlemagne as an adviser on religious and educational matters and as Master of the Palace School, where he established an important library. He was a profound inspiration behind the Carolingian renaissance: he wrote poetry, compiled a sacramentary and was involved in other significant liturgical work, particularly the standardisation of the eucharistic rite.<br><br>In 796, when Alcuin decided to retire, Charlemagne appointed him Abbot of Tours, although not a monk and only in deacon’s orders. He remained here until he died.<br><br>Even though the community numbered over 200 monks, it was not very active, so Alcuin undertook to renew its prestige. He reformed the abbey school, creating two levels of study: one was elementary, the other consisted of the seven liberal arts (grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy). Students came to this from all over Europe. In the monastery he revived the scriptorium where copyists devised a cursive script—the first joined-up writing—which we would still recognise today. He also produced a revised version of the Vulgate Bible, which became the authorised text throughout the kingdom. He remained in close touch with Charlemagne who continued to seek his advice and visited him in Tours just before his coronation in December 800. Alcuin died on Whit Sunday, 19th May 804. As that day was already dedicated to St Dunstan, he is celebrated on the following day, 20th May.<br><br>After his death, Tours continued to be a thriving cultural centre and in 813 a council met in Tours which ruled that clergy should comment on the bible in French rather than Latin.<br><br>We are proud to continue in his tradition.<br><br><br><br>A PRAYER OF ALCUIN OF YORK<br>Eternal light, shine into our hearts,<br>eternal goodness, deliver us from evil,<br>eternal power, be our support,<br>eternal wisdom, scatter the darkness of our ignorance,<br>eternal pity, have mercy upon us;<br>that with all our heart and mind and soul and strength<br>we may seek your face and be brought by your infinite mercy<br>to your holy presence,<br>through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<figure class="post__image post__image--left">So, when we come in<br>through the door, it is expressly to go out again to our everyday lives and relationships.

When we pray for others in the Eucharist, it is so<br>that we may put our concern into action. We are God’s<br>agents in helping to bring that abundant life which he wills<br>for all people, especially to those so obviously without it: the<br>poor, the lonely, the sick.<br><br></p>
<p class="align-center"><br>Need—lack of abundant life—can take many forms, physical,<br>emotional, spiritual. We can be ready to respond to need,<br>whatever it is, by action, by word or by the Christ-like<br>character others look for in us.<br><br><br>We pray that you may find in the Church of St Alcuin in<br>Touraine an example of Christian love and care.<br><br><br><strong>“Sir, we wish to see Jesus”</strong><br><strong><em>S.

<p class="msg msg--warning align-center">We will not tolerate the abuse of children or adults in any form.</p>
<p>Specifically, within our Chaplaincy we are committed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The care, nurture, and respectful pastoral ministry of all children, young persons and adults</li>
<li>The safeguarding and protection of all children, young persons and adults who may be vulnerable</li>
<li>The establishing of safe, caring communities which provide a loving environment where there is a culture of ‘informed vigilance’ as to the dangers of abuse.</li>
<li>The careful selection and training of all those with any safeguarding responsibility within the Church, including the use of available criminal records disclosures and relevant vetting and barring schemes.</li>
<li>Preventing abuse or the likelihood of abuse by encouraging and adopting a pro-active stance to safeguarding; responding to the slightest concern whether by rumour, speculation or from an anonymous source – every safeguarding concern will be taken seriously.</li>
<li>Ensuring that any concern about safeguarding <strong>must</strong> be passed onto someone in the Diocesan Safeguarding Team as there are no legal barriers to sharing such concerns.</li>
<li>Responding without delay to every complaint made which suggests that a child, young person or adult may have been harmed - co-operating with the local police, relevant local agencies and any other relevant body (eg other faith groups) in any investigation.</li>
<li>Seeking to work with anyone who has suffered abuse, developing with them an appropriate ministry of informed pastoral care.</li>
<li>Seeking to challenge any abuse of power, especially by anyone in a position of trust.</li>
<li>Seeking to offer pastoral care and support, including supervision and referral to the proper authorities, to any member of our church community known to have offended against a child, young person or vulnerable adult.</li>
</ul>
