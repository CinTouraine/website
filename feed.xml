                <p>The protection from harm of children and adults who may be vulnerable is of paramount importance to us. As a chaplaincy within the Diocese of Europe, we comply fully with the requirements of the Diocese’s Safeguarding Policy.</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning align-center">We will not tolerate the abuse of children or adults in any form.</p>
<p>Specifically, within our Chaplaincy we are committed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The care, nurture, and respectful pastoral ministry of all children, young persons and adults</li>
<li>The safeguarding and protection of all children, young persons and adults who may be vulnerable</li>
<li>The establishing of safe, caring communities which provide a loving environment where there is a culture of ‘informed vigilance’ as to the dangers of abuse.</li>
<li>The careful selection and training of all those with any safeguarding responsibility within the Church, including the use of available criminal records disclosures and relevant vetting and barring schemes.</li>
<li>Preventing abuse or the likelihood of abuse by encouraging and adopting a pro-active stance to safeguarding; responding to the slightest concern whether by rumour, speculation or from an anonymous source – every safeguarding concern will be taken seriously.</li>
<li>Ensuring that any concern about safeguarding <strong>must</strong> be passed onto someone in the Diocesan Safeguarding Team as there are no legal barriers to sharing such concerns.</li>
<li>Responding without delay to every complaint made which suggests that a child, young person or adult may have been harmed - co-operating with the local police, relevant local agencies and any other relevant body (eg other faith groups) in any investigation.</li>
<li>Seeking to work with anyone who has suffered abuse, developing with them an appropriate ministry of informed pastoral care.</li>
<li>Seeking to challenge any abuse of power, especially by anyone in a position of trust.</li>
<li>Seeking to offer pastoral care and support, including supervision and referral to the proper authorities, to any member of our church community known to have offended against a child, young person or vulnerable adult.</li>
</ul>
<p class="align-left">If you have any queries, please contact the acting Chaplaincy Safeguarding Officer, the Revd John Neal</p>
